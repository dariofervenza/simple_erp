# simple_erp
Simple erp, it is made to manage orders and create excels documents automatically

Django app in development. This is my first time with Django so I know it is not the best possible solution. Also, at the time I did this (more or less, I had almost no practice with js so I avoided it)

I would like to improve it but at this moment I prefer spending my free time in another project.

In the future I will try to add features like more javascript for a dynamic web and re-work visual aspect

Thanks to all! I hope you like it
